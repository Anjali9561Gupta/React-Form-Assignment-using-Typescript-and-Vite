## React Internship Assignment

# Overview

<p>This project is a React application built with TypeScript and Vite. It demonstrates several key functionalities, including form handling, local storage management, data fetching, and creating a hierarchical list component using Material UI (MUI).</p>>

Objectives
Task 1: Set up a React application with TypeScript and Vite, and configure it with Material UI.
Task 2: Create a form to collect user information, store it in local storage, and implement routing between pages.
Task 3: Fetch and display data from an API using the DataGrid component from MUI.
Task 4: Implement a hierarchical list component to display departments and sub-departments with expandable/collapsible functionality, and manage selection state.
Features
User Information Form: Collects name, phone number, and email, saves details to local storage, and handles routing between pages.
Data Display: Fetches JSON data from an API and displays it in a table with pagination using MUIâ€™s DataGrid component.
Hierarchical List: Displays a list of departments with expandable sub-departments. Manages the selection of departments and sub-departments without external libraries.
Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
Vite: Modern build tool for fast development and optimized production builds.
Material UI (MUI): React component library with pre-styled components.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
